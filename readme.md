# Dimensional Cake Rebuilt

I saw that Dimensional Cake was never ported beyond 1.9.4. It was MIT Licensed and I asked if I could take it over just in case there were some source code available.

I have decided to build it from scratch as there was no source code available and have borrowed the textures and other resource files from it.

# What I've done thus far

I have succeeded in creating a cake that when eaten in **The Overworld** will take you to **The End** and if you place and eat it in the **The End** it will take you back to **The Overworld**.

However, it currently does not take you back to exactly where you were and I am working on a solution for this. One suggestion was to use player capabilities which is a whole new ball of wax for me.

I'm wondering if a scoreboard might be easier.

# What needs to be done

An efficient and hopefully elegant way to store the previous dimension and coordinates for easy return.
